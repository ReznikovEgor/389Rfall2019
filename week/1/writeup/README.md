## Assignment Writeup

### Part 1 (25 pts)

This was done via the ELMS assignment.

### Part 2 (75 pts)

In this situation, the first thing would be to talk to my direct superior and explain what I had found. I would make sure that my boss knows how serious this issue is because of the harm it could cause the public. If my boss doesn’t want to work with me to fix the issue, I would try to talk to the higher ups due to the severity of this issue. If no one wants to delay the launch of the car until the ECU firmware is fixed, it becomes an issue for the public. This is when I would try to talk to a consumer watchdog or the public. If the company will not delay the launch, then the public needs to know that there is a problem that can cause damage to the cars consumers buy or even the consumers themselves. One example of engineers talking to their managers and having upper management not changing launch was during the Challenger launch. The engineers saw an issue with the O-rings, which was that cold weather would cause them to freeze and break during launch. They told the managers that if they didn’t deal with this issue there could be a loss of life. Upper management didn’t delay the launch and we lost the lives of those astronauts. If you don’t delay the launch of something that could cause harm to people, most likely something bad will happen.
